## Writing first form

As an example, we will write a simple form with `name` and `age` fields.

```ts
import { createForm } from "@effector-reform/core";
import { allSettled, createEvent, fork, sample } from "effector";

const scope = fork();

const form = createForm({
  schema: {
    name: '',
    age: 0
  },
});

const nameChanged = createEvent<string>();

sample({
  clock: nameChanged,
  target: form.fields.name.change,
});

await allSettled(nameChanged, { scope, params: 'Edward' });

console.log(scope.getState(form.fields.name.$value)); // Edward
```
